# Preface

Please stop right here, if this is your first data engineering book. Whilst some chapters offer examples about simple problems with simple solutions, the majority of the examples described in this book, require that at least you have some knowledge and understanding of the tasks and challenges a data engineer has to deal with. It offers a perspective on how to resolve them, whilst keeping a balance between cost, performance, complexity and time required to implement them.

There are plenty of books, references, articles, abstracts, thesis and even modern media like videos and podcasts available for getting introductions about how to become a data engineer, and in some cases even scams like becoming a proficcient engineer in 1 week or so. I am unfamiliar with an engineering profession that reaches higher proficiency levels without exercising your engineeneus self. That being said, we all learn from others, from referneces, from books, and likely we find inspiration from the work of others, and make interpretations ourselves or new representations that help us exercise the engineer in ourself.

This book, is a reflection in a 25 year journey of engineering information technology solutions dealing with data, and problems that somehow recurrently appear across different industries and somehow find relevant when solving data problems.
